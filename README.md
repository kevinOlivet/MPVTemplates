# MPVTemplates
MVP Templates for a scene and unit tests

Put them in the Templates folder of Xcode found here: 
cd~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates

Once you add them to the project they will be as Folders.  
You'll need to delete them (Remove References) and add them again.
Be sure to give them the correct target membership.
